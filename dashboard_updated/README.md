# Web Development Project 6 - BrewFinder

Submitted by: **Nguyen Duy Phuc Le**

This web app: **Data can tell interesting stories. In this two-part project, you will create a data dashboard that provides an at-a-glance summary of information gathered from a public API. In part one, you choose a public API and construct the dashboard view of the project. The dashboard view contains summary statistics and a list view of the data that can be searched and filtered. The dashboard should tell an interesting story about the data and spark the user’s curiosity, inviting them to learn more.**
